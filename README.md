Kirana Express is a test website that helps us see if our idea for a grocery delivery service works.
We want to connect people with grocery stores so they can look at products add them to a cart and then get them delivered or pick them up.
The prices are clear and shown at the store level so customers know what they are paying.
* This project is more about seeing if the website is easy to use and if the ordering process makes sense than building the whole system.
It uses web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript to show how a simple online store could work.
Things like adding items to a cart and managing products work smoothly without needing to reload the page.
The main aim of Kirana Express is to find out if a simple trustworthy system for ordering groceries locally can be built and expanded to areas.
We are testing the Kirana Express to see if it can really help people order groceries from stores in a smooth way.
The Kirana Express website shows how we can use technology to make shopping, for groceries
By testing Kirana Express we hope to learn how to make a grocery delivery service.
In Kirana Express we focus on making the shopping experience simple and trustworthy.
The goal of Kirana Express is to help people buy groceries from stores easily.
